# GolfSite

GolfSite is a website developed for a local mini-golf business, **My Adventure Golf**, to streamline operations and enhance the user experience. 
The platform allows for management of employee schedules, time-off requests, and user authentication with varying permission levels for employees, managers,
and administrators. This project was developed by a team of four, Caden Conde, John Jones, Xander Combs, and Eric Bucher.

## Features

- **Authentication System**: Coded in PHP and SQL, the system allows secure login for both employees and managers, each with different levels of access.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 
  - *Employees*: Can view schedules, request time off, and manage their availability.
  - *Managers*: Can approve or deny time-off requests, modify schedules, and manage employee data.
  - *Admins*: Have full control over the system, including database management and user permissions.
- **Scheduling System**: Includes features such as:
